# ShopYourHeroes-ecommerce

In this project, I wanted to create a "super heroe shop store". This is why all listed items are from my favorite heroes (and some foes!). I wrote mainly using Vanilla Javascript, but in the future, I'll give it a go with React Js, just to practice. Feel free to check the items I selected, from a mockup API developed for this project.
